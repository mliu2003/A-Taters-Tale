              A Taterâ€™s Tale aims to provide a visualization for the beautiful
              life of a potato, following from its origin on the farm to its
              consumption on the plate.

              Potatoes produce about 0.46 kilogram of greenhouse gases per
              kilogram of potato produced, making it one of the lowest producers
              of greenhouse gases (relative to other food products).

              Russet potatoes are by far the most popular variety of potatoes
              planted, with about 80,000 acres of farmland being used to plant
              russet potatoes.

              Though many factors can affect the output, potatoes are one of the
              most efficient crops to plant, having a higher value than cost per
              acre grown.

            <p>
              Potatoes are transported across the states by truck! There is a
              truck called the Big Idaho Potato Truck that carries a 4-ton
              potato across the country every year.

              far surpasses that of any other state, with Washington at second,

              Compared to similar carbs, potatoes are an excellent source of
              nutrition.

            <p>
              While popular carbs can also serve as adequate sources of
              nutrition, potatoes are capable of providing similar or even
              higher amounts of vital macronutrients. As an added bonus,
              potatoes act as a great nutrient source while having lower
              calories than other carbs, making potatoes a great weight
