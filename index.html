            <h2>Welcome to A Tater's Tale</h2>
            <p>
              A Taterâ€™s Tale aims to provide a visualization for the beautiful
              life of a potato, following from its origin on the farm to its
              consumption on the plate. Specifically, we will focus on three
              important stages of the potato. First, we will take a deep dive
              into the birth of potatoes, comparing production quantities from
              across states and regions. Next, we track these potatoes across
              their journey, visualizing the import and export rates of potatoes
              throughout the United States. Lastly, we will explore the
              different ways in which potatoes are consumed, whether that means
              being mashed, baked, or becoming a bag of chips.

            <p>
              Potatoes produce about 0.46 kilogram of greenhouse gases per
              kilogram of potato produced, making it one of the lowest producers
              of greenhouse gases (relative to other food products).
