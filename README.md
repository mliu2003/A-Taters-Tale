# A Tater's Tale
Max Liu, Derek Xie, Daniel Duan, Alyse Kwok

A Tater’s Tale aims to provide a visualization for the beautiful life of a potato, following from its origin on the farm to its consumption on the plate. Specifically, we will focus on three important stages of the potato. First, we will take a deep dive into the birth of potatoes, comparing production quantities from across states and regions. Next, we track these potatoes across their journey, visualizing the import and export rates of potatoes throughout the United States. Lastly, we will explore the different ways in which potatoes are consumed, whether that means being mashed, baked, or becoming a bag of chips.

# How to run
Start a local server
```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view the visualizations

The project is also hosted at https://mliu2003.github.io/A-Taters-Tale/
